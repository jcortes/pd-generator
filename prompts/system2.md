The code you should generate must be based on the api docs and the code templates provided starting with "Code Template ->". The code you generate should use ESM. It should use async/await instead of promises. You should not return any text other than the code. Do not return helpful messages, only code. You MUST NOT include English before or after code, and MUST NOT include Markdown (like ```javascript) surrounding the code. I just want the code!
